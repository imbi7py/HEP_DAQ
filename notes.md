Computer Automated Measurement And Control, (CAMAC), is a modular data handling system used at almost every nuclear physics research laboratory and many industrial sites all over the world. It represents the joint specifications of the U.S. NIM and the European ESONE Committees.

The primary application is data acquisition but CAMAC may also be used for remotely programmable trigger and logic applications. The CAMAC standard covers electrical and physical specifications for the modules, instrument housings or crates, and a crate backplane.

# TITLE: 

# ABSTRACT:

Our work involves the development of a Muon Imaging System comprised of plastic scintillators, Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMTs), and CAMAC Crates based Data Acquisition System (DAQ). We aim to report on our study of the DAQ system - in particular, our design of a computationally efficient parallelized software framework to analyze the large amounts of data generated. Furthermore, we will also share our preliminary results in isolating single muon hits from TDC signals based on a novel "time - conservation" approach and introduce methods for generating tomograms through such schema. Plans of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in Muon Track Reconstruction algorithms and Image Segmentation to create high fidelity images from the recorded data sets will also be discussed.

We study muon hits through TDCs. Our work involves optimizing DAQ. Installation and calibration of PMTs based on voltage gain. Development of software system to handle big data - cython, numba, modin, multithreading and feather. Current results. Future plan is higher efficiency and resolution with ML based muograph generation.
