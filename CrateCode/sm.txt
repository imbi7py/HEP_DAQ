Properties of heterogeneous traffic flow are determined by behaviors of individual agents and how they interact. Unlike human drivers/vehicles (HVs), whose behaviors are mostly predetermined, the behaviors of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can be purposefully designed. This raises the question of how autonomous vehicle behaviors should be designed so that autonomous and human-driven vehicles utilize the roadway in an efficient and harmonized fashion. This paper aims to contribute to the understanding of this question, with a particular focus on developing design for autonomous vehicles to boost their spontaneous platooning in heterogeneous traffic flow. We present results of two aspects. We first propose stochastic urn models to approximate the dynamics of spontaneous platooning by considering agentsâ€™ swapping of relative locations in heterogeneous traffic flow. Equilibrium distributions of platoon sizes are derived when agents are endowed with different behavioral characters. We also derive the Fokker-Planck equation that sheds light on the limit of such distributions when the system size is large. Then we conduct simulation experiments to verify our analytical insights, where two characters of AVs are considered: namly, neighbor awareness, and opportunisticity. We observe that, intriguingly, AVs could form into platoons spon- taneously without centralized control, as long as they are endowed with proper types of behavior.  Our findings indicate the potential of regulating future mixed autonomous traffic flow through
 agent behavior design and cooperations.
