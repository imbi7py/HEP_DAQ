      corrected bug related to loss of MSB Byte on Block Transfer read binary 24-bit Repeat Mode

Firmware release 2.10 improvements and additions:
**********************************************************

        1) 	Fixed flag Run On Boot operation on LUA script automatic execution

	2) 	Shell start up modifications: 
	As the system is started, the shell script /app/start is executed; the firmware contains the command line:
  
   	sh /data/custom_start
   
	Normally the shell script custom_start is not present, therefore the command execution is neglected. 
	The User can add the fore mentioned shell script in order to execute additional commands to be performed 
       at system boot, for example to update the system clok via SNTP server;
	For example, the  shell script custom_start can be created by typing at prompt: 
   	echo "/app/msntp -r -l /ram/msntp.pid -P no 192.168.0.1" > /data/custom_start


	3) 	The SNTP client is hosted in the folder /app; the executable filename is msntp (it is recommended 
        to be used exclusively as a client)

	The command line options are as follows

==================================================================

    msntp [ --help | -h | -? ] [ -v | -V | -W ]
          [ { -r | -a } [ -P prompt ] [ -l lockfile ] ]
          [ -c count ] [ -e minerr ][ -E maxerr ]
          [ -d delay | -x [ separation ] [ -f savefile ] ]
          [ address(es) ] ]



    --help, -h and -? all print the syntax of the command.

    -v indicates that diagnostic messages should be written to standard error,
and -V requests more output for investigating apparently inconsistent timestamps.  
-W requests very verbose debugging output, and will interfere with the timing 
when writing to the terminal (because of line buffered output from C); 
it is useful only when debugging the source.  Note that the times produced by -V 
and -W are the corrections needed, and not the error in the local clock.

    -r indicates that the system clock should be reset by 'settimeofday'.
Naturally, this will work only if the user has enough privilege.

    -a indicates that the system clock should be reset by 'adjtime'.
Naturally, this will work only if the user has enough privilege.

    -x indicates that the program should run as a daemon (i.e. forever), and
allow for clock drift.

The default is to write the current date and time to the standard output in
a format like '1996 Oct 15 20:17:25.123 + 4.567 +/- 0.089 secs', indicating the
estimated true (local) time and the error in the local clock.  In daemon mode,
it will add drift information in a format like ' + 1.3 +/- 0.1 ppm', and
display this at roughly 'separation' intervals.

    'minerr' is the maximum ignorable variation between the clocks. 
Acceptable values are from 0.001 to 1, and the default is 0.1 if 'address' is specified
and 0.5 otherwise.

    'maxerr' is the maximum value of various delays that are deemed acceptable.
Acceptable values are from 1 to 60, and the default is 5.  It should sometimes
be increased if there are problems with the network, NTP server or system
clock, but take care.

    'prompt' is the maximum clock change that will be made automatically.
Acceptable values are from 1 to 3600, and the default is 30.  If the program 
is being run interactively, larger values will cause a prompt.  The value may 
also be 'no', and the change will be made without prompting.

    'count' is the maximum number of NTP packets to require.  Acceptable 
values are from 1 to 25 if 'address' is specified and '-x' is not, and from 5 to 25
otherwise; the default is 5.  If the maximum isn't enough, you need a better
consistency algorithm than this program uses.  Don't increase it.

    'delay' is a rough limit on the total running time in seconds. 
Acceptable values are from 1 to 3600, and the default is 15 if 'address' is specified 
and 300 otherwise.

    'separation' is the time to wait between calls to the server in minutes if
'address' is specified, and the minimum time between broadcast packets if not.
Acceptable values are from 1 to 1440 (a day), and the default is 300.

    'lockfile' may be used in an update mode to ensure that there is only
one copy of msntp running at once.  The default is installation-dependent,
but will usually be /etc/msntp.pid.

    'savefile' may be used in daemon mode to store a record of previous
packets, which may speed up recalculating the drift after msntp has to be
restarted (e.g. because of network or server outages).  The default is
installation-dependent, but will usually be /etc/msntp.state.  Note that
there is no locking of this file, and using it twice may cause chaos.

    'address' is the DNS name or IP number of a host to poll; if no name is
given, the program waits for broadcasts.  Note that a single component numeric
address is not allowed.

detection and block transfer  

NIM I/O Section - various functions available: outputs, inputs, event 
counters, pulse generators, COMBO I/O (trigger/busy) modules

Remote Control Library - ANSI C remote control library derived from 
the ESONE standard, with extensions to control local resources and 
dedicated block transfer functions
